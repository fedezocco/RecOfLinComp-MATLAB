Note that the datasets are not uploaded in this folder because too large. See Table 1 in my paper for the links to download the public datasets. Xwafer and Xsemicon are not shared for confidentiality reasons.


## Dependencies of folders and files

There is a folder for dimensionality reduction and a folder for variable selection. The scripts named "Simulation_" in each folder generate the paper results and show the use of the functions. Plots are created at the and of each script. Once specified the path of a dataset, the scripts should be ready to run.
